# MalariaNeuralNetwork
Neural network that clasifies cases of severe and non-severe malaria

This project focuses on using artificial inteligence int medical fields, especifically in the detection of posible complications in malaria cases. The amount of inputs in the neural network is given by a set of questions focused on detecting symptoms of complications in malaria.

#Those inputs are:
-Dyspnea (Yes - No)
-Vomiting (Yes - No)
-Precendence of malaria (Yes - No)
-Previous use of AntiMalarials (Yes - No)
-Fever (Yes - No)
-Mean arterial pressure (Map)
-Hemoglobine in percentage (hb)
-Leukocyte count (leukoc)
-Platelet count (platel)
-Total bilirrubin level (bilir)
